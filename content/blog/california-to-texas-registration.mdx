Moving from California to Texas? One of the most important tasks on your checklist is transferring your vehicle registration. This comprehensive guide will walk you through every step of the process.

## Understanding Texas Registration Requirements

When you establish residency in Texas, you have **30 days** to register your vehicle with the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles (TxDMV). Failing to do so can result in fines and penalties.

## Required Documents

Before heading to your local county tax office, make sure you have all the necessary documents:

<Checklist items={[
  "California vehicle title (must be in your name)",
  "Valid Texas driver's license or ID",
  "Proof of Texas auto insurance",
  "Vehicle Inspection Report (Form VIR)",
  "Completed Application for Texas Title (Form 130-U)",
  "Proof of identity and residency",
  "Payment for registration fees and taxes"
]} />

## Step 1: Get a Texas Vehicle Inspection

All vehicles must pass a Texas safety inspection before registration. This includes:

- Brake system check
- Steering and suspension inspection
- Lighting and electrical systems
- Horn and exhaust system
- Windshield wipers and mirrors
- Tires and wheels

Find an authorized inspection station near you and obtain your Vehicle Inspection Report (VIR). The inspection typically costs $7-$25 and is valid for 90 days.

## Step 2: Obtain Texas Auto Insurance

Texas requires minimum liability coverage:

- $30,000 per person for bodily injury
- $60,000 per accident for bodily injury
- $25,000 per accident for property damage

## Step 3: Complete Form 130-U

The Application for Texas Title and/or Registration (Form 130-U) is required for all out-of-state vehicle transfers.

Fill out the form completely and accurately. You'll need:

- Vehicle identification number (VIN)
- Current odometer reading
- Purchase price or current market value
- Lienholder information (if applicable)

## Step 4: Visit Your County Tax Office

Take all your documents to your local county tax assessor-collector's office. They will:

1. Verify your documents
2. Calculate registration fees and taxes
3. Issue your Texas license plates
4. Provide your registration sticker

### Fees to Expect

- **Title fee**: $33
- **Registration fee**: $50.75 (standard passenger vehicle)
- **Local fees**: Varies by county ($10-$20)
- **Motor vehicle sales tax**: 6.25% of vehicle value

<Callout type="success">
Texas doesn't charge sales tax on vehicles you already own and are transferring from another state, as long as you can prove you've owned it for more than 90 days.

## Step 5: Surrender Your California Plates

California requires you to surrender your license plates when you move out of state. You can:

- Mail them to: California DMV, PO Box 942869, Sacramento, CA 94269
- Drop them off at any California DMV office
- Recycle them at a California metal recycling facility

## Special Considerations

### Leased Vehicles

If your vehicle is leased, you'll need additional documentation from the leasing company, including:

- Leasing agreement
- Power of attorney from the lessor
- Lienholder information

### Military Personnel

Active-duty military members stationed in Texas may be exempt from certain requirements. Contact your base's vehicle registration office for guidance.

### Electric Vehicles

Electric vehicle owners pay an additional $200 annual fee in Texas to offset lost gas tax revenue.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Waiting too long**: Register within 30 days to avoid penalties
2. **Incomplete inspection**: Ensure your vehicle passes all inspection points
3. **Missing documents**: Double-check you have everything before visiting the tax office
4. **Incorrect form completion**: Fill out Form 130-U accurately to avoid delays

## Timeline Summary

Here's a realistic timeline for the entire process:

- **Day 1-3**: Obtain Texas auto insurance
- **Day 4-7**: Get vehicle inspection
- **Day 8-10**: Gather all required documents
- **Day 11-14**: Visit county tax office and complete registration
- **Day 15-30**: Surrender California plates
